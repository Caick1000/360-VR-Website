1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/PatrickRNG/360-VR-Website/`

**Branchs**
For now there is only a `dev` and `master` branch, soon we will be using [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as our workflow.
`DEV` - For development (features, adjustment, fixes, etc).
`MASTER` - For production, a release.
